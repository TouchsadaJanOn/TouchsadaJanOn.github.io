                        <p>
                            Hello, My name is Touchsada Jan On and I go by Touch. Today I'm going to talk about my project 10 in BACS200. Today I am going to talk about the first responders. I have 4 main topics to introduce before we start: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> First, I will talk about who and what the first responders are</li>
                            <li> Second, I will talk about how one can become a part of a first responders team.</li>
                            <li> Third, I will talk about the nonprofit organization that I have researched: Greeley Fire Department.</li>
                            <li> My last topic will be the importance of having a first responder.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> First, Who and what are the first responders. First responders are a person with specialized training who is among the first to arrive and provide assistance at the scene of an emergency. Those emergencies could be a car accident, a house fire, a chemical spill, some hazardous events, or a natural disaster.
                            <br> And Who are these people?
                            <br>Some examples are EMT or Emergency Medical Technicians, paramedics, firefighter, and police officer. </p>
                        <p>Here comes my second topic, how does one become a first responder?
                            <br> The very first step is for you to earn your high school diploma, if you don't have that, you can take classes that help you pass your GED test, which is equivalent to earning a high school diploma.
                            <br><em> Step 2: </em>you will decide what team of the first responders you want to be a part of. You can become an EMR (Emergency Medical Respond), an EMT, again that stands for Emergency Medical Technician. The difference between these two teams is EMT is a higher level of care than an EMR. EMR are limited to BLS (Basic Life Support) skills such as CPR, splinting, and patient assessments. EMTs can do everything an EMR can do with a slightly larger scope of practice including basic airway adjuncts and suctioning. That sounds pretty cool! You can also be a police officer or a firefighter
                            <br><em>EMR: </em> you must take a state-approved First Responder/EMR course.
                            <br><em>EMT: </em> you’ll have to complete a state-approved EMT certificate program. Most programs require you to have already completed CPR training before starting.
                            <br><em>Police: </em>you’ll need to attend the police academy.
                            <br><em>Firefighter: </em>This depending on the state you live in. You’ll also need to attend Fire Academy training. Some programs require you to have an associate’s or bachelor’s degree.
                        </p>
                        <p> For my third topic, I will be talking about the Greeley Fire Department. Their vision is to serve Greeley and its people. Each person is dedicated to serving with honor, integrity, and respect. During disastrous events under pressure and stress, where human life is the number one priority, safety is still the primary procedure in order to efficiently maintain the situation and keep the situation under control. These firefighters can help train you on Fire code compliance, New construction permits and plan review, fire protection systems permits and plan review, and more. This training will help you ensure yours and your spouse's safety with your household. You can meet them at events like school visits, career fairs, and Medical stand-by. Scroll down to see more about them! </p>
                        <p>Lastly my last topic, Why do we need first responder. Generally speaking, they are the primary line of defense within the US community. They respond to natural and man-made threats. They have the professional training of how to save a life and how to get people out of life-threatening events. When your life is at risk, the first responders are train to risk their lives to save yours. Basically, in simple and short, we need the first responders because no stranger will risk their lives to safe yours, and if they did, there's a big chance that both of you might die together because they haven't receive any professional or proper training. So it is a good idea to have someone who knows what they are doing when it comes to saving someone's life.</p>
                        <p> That will be all of this video Thank you so much for watching!
