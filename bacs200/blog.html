            COVID-19 has spread to all countries of the world. Social and physical distancing, lockdowns of businesses, schools, and overall social life have disrupted many regular aspects of life, including sport and physical activity. Also because of the irregular interaction with friends and family members, everyone is frustrated and angry. Some people may say that the time off was good because they can spend more time with their family and relax all day, but when it comes to financial stability, people struggled to acknowledge that their "time-off" is actually good. Social distancing presents the dangers of increasing social rejection, growing impersonality and individualism, and the loss of a sense of community." It negatively affects learning and growth, and it prevents people from effectively socializing, which is a fundamental human need.

        <h2 class="ml-4 mr-4 display-5 text-secondary bg-warning p-3"><u>Economics Implications</u><img src="https://www.seattlebusinessmag.com/sites/default/files/field/image/coronavirus-impact-on-economy-vector-id1210280191.jpg" alt="Mask" width=450px height=230px class=" float-right"></h2>
        <p class="d-block text-light bg-dark ml-4 mr-4 p-4">
            COVID-19 doesn't only impact our social life, but also our economics. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul class="mr-4 ml-4">
            <li>Small business revenue is down 20% since January.</li>
            <li>Bankruptcies have increased relative to last year.</li>
            <li>New business formations fell off in the Spring during the lockdown.</li>
            <li>In 26 states, more than 1 in 5 households were behind on rent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="d-block text-light bg-dark ml-4 mr-4 p-4">
            As you can see from the examples above, the pandemic has created an unexpected demand shock, a supply shock, and a financial shock for all Americans. Though, there are some economical increases in online platforms such as Amazon, Zoom, Microsoft Team, Skype, and FaceTime that have been exponentially increasing.</p>

        <h2 class="ml-4 mr-4 display-5 text-secondary bg-warning p-3"><u>Political Implications</u><img src="https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2020/02/05091635/vote-for-blog.jpg" alt="vote" width=400px height=230px class=" float-right"></h2>
        <p class="d-block text-light bg-dark ml-4 mr-4 p-4">
            With the current election coming up, the USA has taken many precautions to guarantee safe in-person voting, including requiring masks and staggering voting hours. Some states have successfully expanded voting by mail. Even though Americans have successfully found the safest way to vote, some challenges remain in holding elections during this difficult time. For example, lack of funding, technical glitches, low turnout, and legitimacy concerns. The pandemic also affects the election campaign between President Trump and Joe Biden, as well as, party conventions will be scaled down dramatically for the safety of the people and maintained social distancing and avoiding a big group of gathering. </p>

            In conclusion, the pandemic has affected many countries worldwide. The topics that were mentioned the most were how COVID-19 positively and negatively affects politics, economics, and social life. As the rest of the world experience this hard time, we adapt to the situation and get stronger as a nation. The situation was hard for many people, but they were able to overcome it. For example, people saw the importance of the "Black Life Matter" movement, therefore they stepped out of their comfort zone to support the cause. Also, we can definitely see people helping out each other and family members interact with one another more often. I believe that Pandemic helps us prepare and adapt for future problems. </p>
